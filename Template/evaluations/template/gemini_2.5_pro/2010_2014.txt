Overall Score (1-10): 9

Brief Justification: The summary is highly informative, well-written, and logically structured, covering all key aspects of the weather data. It correctly identifies the date range, temperature extremes, and most averages. The score is reduced slightly for two minor factual inaccuracies: the seasonal variation was calculated as 24.6 ∘C (not 24.7 ∘C) and the average annual precipitation was 834.5 mm (not 834.6 mm), likely due to different rounding methods.
