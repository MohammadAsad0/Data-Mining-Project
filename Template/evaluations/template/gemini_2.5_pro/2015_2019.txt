Overall Score (1-10): 9

Brief Justification (2-3 sentences): The summary is excellent—highly fluent, coherent, and informative, capturing the dataset's key insights, extremes, and seasonal patterns. It only loses a point for a single, minor factual inaccuracy: the annual precipitation average is reported as 861.5 mm, while the data (4307.1 mm total / 5 years) calculates to 861.42 mm. Otherwise, all other statistics and dates are factually correct.
