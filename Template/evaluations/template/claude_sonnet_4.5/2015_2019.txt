Overall Score (1-10): 7.5
Brief Justification: The summary is factually accurate on the verifiable extremes and provides a good overview of temperature ranges, seasonal patterns, and precipitation. However, it's somewhat mechanical in presentation and could be more insightful—it focuses heavily on basic statistics without exploring interesting patterns like notable weather events, year-over-year trends, or contextual interpretation of the 5-year period. The correlation mention feels tacked on rather than meaningfully integrated. The writing is clear and grammatical, but lacks the narrative flow that would make it more engaging and useful for understanding Toronto's weather patterns over this period.
